- pillow

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the project:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gilangnrl/application-of-image-classification-using-vgg16-using-flask
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd application-of-image-classification-using-vgg16-using-flask
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

## Project Structure

- `model/`: Contains model used with `.h5`,`hdf5` format (folder empty because the size is to large).
- `app.py`: Flask application for serving the model and routing.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for the web interface.
- `static/`: Directory for static files (CSS, images, etc.).
- `requirements.txt`: File containing all required Python packages and versions.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed!
